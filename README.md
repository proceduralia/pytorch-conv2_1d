# Pytorch Conv(2+1)D
Pytorch implementation of (2+1)D spatiotemporal convolutions, as presented in the paper [A Closer Look at Spatiotemporal Convolutions for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11248). The API offered by the _Conv2_1d_ module
is the same as the built-in _Conv3d_ Pytorch module.

Following the same principles, a (2+1)D transposed convolution module is implemented.
